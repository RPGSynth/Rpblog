Hi! I’m a young data scientist— and, dare I say, a humanist too.  
I like studying a bit of everything, and this blog is my place to collect those curiosities: ideas, readings, side projects, and whatever else catches my attention.

I hope you find something interesting here.

Welcome to my big bazaar.
