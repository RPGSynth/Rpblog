*This page gathers my thoughts while I'm reading Søren Kierkegaard’s essay **The Sickness Unto Death**, chapter by chapter.  
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do !*

{{< chapter title="Preface" >}}

My first impression is that Kierkegaard does **not** want his work to be compared to the work of scientists. I’m not sure whether this comes from a broader, traditional opposition (in his time) between theology and science, or whether it is something more singular to Kierkegaard’s own vision.

One line I underlined captures this concern clearly:

> “If [...] the form is too strict to be edifying, that according to my conception would be a fault.”

In other words, if a text is *formally correct* but fails to *edify*—to build up the reader inwardly—then it has missed its purpose. To me, that emphasis feels strikingly unfamiliar today.

Kierkegaard seems to criticize scientific thinking when it presents itself as *the* defining ideal of humanity. He resists the idea that understanding should come primarily from neutral, exterior observation—knowledge “from the outside,” for its own sake. Instead, he opposes this to what he calls **Christian heroism**, rooted in holiness.

For Kierkegaard, the true concern must be tied to our inwards feelings:

> “Concern implies relationship to life to the reality of personal existence.”

This reminds me that Kierkegaard is, before anything else, a Christian believer.[^belief-note] His suspicion toward “neutral” understanding is very strong—almost the reverse of modern intellectual instincts. Today, neutrality often feels like the holy grail of intelligence; for him, holiness is the only seriousness that matters.

He writes:

> “Seriousness again is the edifying.”

I take this to mean: the only seriousness he ultimately recognizes is the seriousness of the spiritual life—seriousness before God.

Finally, Kierkegaard anticipates that the essay’s form may seem convoluted. He seems to emphasize this partly to avoid misunderstanding: **despair is not a cure**, and it is not a positive concept. It is, plainly, a **sickness of the spirit**.

This will matter in the chapters that follow, because despair is a deeply polarized idea in Kierkegaard—what he calls a **dialectical** concept.

[^belief-note]: "Christian" could likely be replaced with "religious" in a broader sense (depending on what one wants to emphasize), but Kierkegaard's framework here is explicitly Christian.

{{< chapter title="Introduction" >}}
In the *Introduction*, Kierkegaard mostly present the idea that there exists a true sickness that is worse than death or should I say worse than bodily death. 

He starts with a quote from the Bible:

> “So then Lazarus is dead, and yet this sickness was not unto death; [...]”

That caught my attention because direct Bible quotes are not *that* frequent in the essay (at least so far, this is the only one I’ve met). And it also works as a perfect summary of the core idea: **bodily death is not the “true” death**. So the “sickness unto death” has to be something else—something deeper.

Kierkegaard says it quite clearly:

> “Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is only a little event within that which is all, an eternal life; [...]”

From a Christian point of view, death isn’t the final word, in fact it is pretty positive. There is, as he says, “infinitely much more hope” than what we get from a purely human perspective. So if *not even death* is the sickness unto death… then the title becomes even more mesmerizing. If death isn’t it, what on earth is?

And then Kierkegaard starts describing this thing. He is genuinely scared of it—and he thinks we should be scared too. He calls it:

> “An evil which as such does not know of”

That’s such a strange and interesting idea: an evil that can exist *without even knowing itself*, like something hidden in plain sight. He also says that non-believers don’t really understand it. He even goes pretty far and compares the non-believer to a child in one of his (numerous) beautiful phrasing :

> “Such is the relation between the natural man and the Christian, it is like the relationship between a child and a man: what the child shudders at the man regards as nothing. The child does not know what the dreadful is; this the man knows, and he shudders at it.”

Not the nicest thing to say about non-believers — but it makes sense if we take seriously how Kierkegaard sees things. The “dreadful” here is not bodily death; it’s something spiritual, something deeper. And he argues that the Christian (and he explicitly says “the Christian,” so he is including heathens *as outside of that*) has a kind of courage that non-believers don’t share: the courage to face this dreadful thing.

At this stage he still doesn’t give the full name of the sickness unto death yet, but the shape of it is already there: it’s worse than bodily death, it can hide itself, and it has to do with what a person is in relation to the divine or what he will call later the eternal.

{{< chapter title="Chapter 1: That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death" >}}

This chapter is, in many ways, where Kierkegaard lays down the foundations of everything that follows. If someone wanted to get a strong sense of his thought without going *too* deep into the essay, I honestly think this chapter could almost be enough. I even hesitated to continue reading—partly because it already feels so complete, and partly because it’s so dense that you want to sit with it for a while.

It’s also just… beautifully written. There are moments of genuine literary ecstasy, the kind where you struggle *not* to highlight every single line. Some pages are almost ridiculous in how good they are. {{< figure src="Screenshots/1.jpg" caption="I am not lying to you when I tell you there is a lot ! " >}}

### Despair and its forms

In my edition of the essay, this sentence "That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death" is printed in **big, bold letters**—and my copy is (sadly? proudly?) being absolutely *murdered* by my highlighter, so the point is not exactly subtle (I warned you this part is rich). This is because this idea is the central claim of the essay: despair—whatever despair really is—brings about a kind of true death, deeper than bodily death. That’s exactly what drew me in: I wanted to understand the feeling of desperation better, and see what intellectuals had to say about it. 

Kierkegaard goes straight to the point and I have to cite him:

> “Despair is a sickness of the spirit, in the self. [...] It may assume a triple form: despair at not being conscious of having a self; despair at not willing to be oneself; and despair at willing to be oneself.”

He then proceeds to hit us with a definition that feels almost hypnotic:

> “Man is spirit; but what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self.”

Pretty mesmerizing, honestly.

From there he starts talking in terms of **relations**. Which means… we can represent his ideas with charts! This is great news for me, because I love charts.

He argues that the human being is a **synthesis**—between the infinite and the finite, the spirit and the body. Personally I’m not totally convinced by the spirit-vs-body framing anymore; it feels a bit dated to me. Still, Kierkegaard uses this language to build something more subtle, and then he goes into a (honestly convoluted) discussion that I’ve tried to summarize with a couple of graphs. This is also where he introduces his **three** forms of despair (and yes: three is a very satisfying number which feels somewhat subjective).

{{< figure src="Graphs/G1.png" caption="The soul as a relation between the spirit and the body." >}}
{{< figure src="Graphs/G2.png" caption="The self as a relation that relates itself to itself." >}}

He sees the soul as a relation between spirit and body. And he argues that the **self** appears when this relation *turns back on itself*—when the relation relates to itself. I find this idea genuinely elegant: it captures something deeply recursive about inward feelings, the way we can feel, then feel ourselves feeling, then reflect on that reflection… and so on. I never quite manged to put words on this feelings and I feel like he did. 

He then says this “self-relation” can be understood in two ways: one where the relation constitutes itself (see the graph above), and one where it is constituted by another—namely, God (see below).
{{< figure src="Graphs/G3.png" caption="The self as a relation that relates itself to itself and god." >}}
Here, because Kierkegaard is a believer—a **Christian** believer—he insists that the synthesis (this recursive relation between spirit and body) is also related to **God**. So if a person is not properly related to God, their synthesis—meaning their self[^self-def-note]—is doomed to fall out of balance. And for Kierkegaard, that imbalance is exactly what opens the door to despair.

He argues that if the self *constitutes itself*—if God has no role in it—then despair can only take one form: **not willing to be one’s own self**. In that secular framework, there shouldn’t really be “despair at willing to be oneself,” because if *you* are the one defining what you are at every moment, then willing to be yourself shouldn’t fundamentally be a problem. This is actually interesting, because it starts to sound a bit like some non-believer existentialism.

[^self-def-note]: The “self,” the “synthesis” between spirit and body, and the “relation relating itself to itself” are all, for Kierkegaard, different ways of pointing to the same idea. I use them interchangeably (more or less the way he does).

Kierkegaard writes:

> “The self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to the Power which constituted the whole relation.”

So without acknowledging God (the divine), the self cannot remain stable: it is destined to become unbalanced. And this is where Kierkegaard’s warning becomes strong: **trying to become yourself without relating yourself to God is dangerous**. In fact, you may sink deeper into despair, because you are trying to “achieve yourself” through your own effort alone. For Kierkegaard, you can’t just work on yourself to find yourself—you must also find yourself *in God*.

In that sense, “despair at willing to be yourself” becomes, for him, another form of despair that ultimately still belongs under the larger umbrella of “not willing to be yourself”: by willing to be yourself so intensely, you end up refusing the only grounding that can truly hold the self together.

He warns:

> “If a man in despair is as he thinks conscious of his despair, [...] and if by himself only he would abolish the despair; then by all labor he expends he is only laboring himself deeper and deeper into despair.”

This is one of the moments where the text shows how deeply theological it is. Kierkegaard doesn’t really try to “prove” that the secular (no-God) view is wrong. He assumes it is incomplete, and then he pushes forward from there. He tells us: even the project of pursuing your own self—if it is done without God—is itself despair.

Of course, if you don’t believe in God, you might feel that the first definition is enough—and that trying to be yourself cannot, *by itself*, be despair. Kierkegaard refuses that. And honestly, at this point it’s hard to sort everything into simple “right” or “wrong.” I also don’t think that’s what the essay is trying to do: it never sets out to prove or disprove the existence of God. God is assumed as a given, and the whole argument unfolds from that starting point.

### Possibility and Actuality of Despair

This is the part I struggled with at first—probably because I hadn’t really been exposed (before Kierkegaard) to the whole philosophy dialogue around *actuality vs possibility* (and, later, *necessity vs possibility*). Here, Kierkegaard explains why despair is what he calls **dialectical**: because despair is self-reflective, it can’t be described as a simple possibility *or* a simple actuality. It is both at once, tied together in movement. He will later extend this structure to other opposed pairs as well (finitude/infinitude, temporal/eternal, etc.).

Kierkegaard starts with a tempting question: isn’t despair—at least as a *possibility*—a good thing? One might think that the possibility of despair is an advantage over the beast. After all, a tuna (some might heavily disagree, but that deserves an other -series of- post) cannot despair because it has no spirit. The fact that we can despair proves we have a relationship to the eternal, it makes the human closer to God, since after all he writes

> To be healed of this sickness is the Christian bliss.

But he immediately corrects this.
In a normal case, possibility and actuality don’t relate in a dialectical way. I’m paraphrasing, but he basically says: *Normally, if it’s an advantage to be able to be something, it is an even greater advantage to actually be it.* But with despair, it doesn’t work like that. The **possibility** of despair can indeed be an advantage (and even an infinite one, if it leads the despairer toward God). Yet the **actuality** of despair is also infinitely dangerous, because in despair the self can lose itself—perhaps forever.

And because despair is dialectical, because possibility and actuality are always intertwined, always together yet always opposed—we have to fight it constantly. The positive “actuality” of *not* being in despair is not something that simply *rests there*: it is a kind of negation, the possibility of despair continually held in check—an annihilated possibility.

Another important point: the synthesis (the spirit–body relation, also called the soul) is *only* the **possibility** of despair. If despair were the **actuality** built into human nature from the start, then despair would be universal and “normal”—and in that case it wouldn’t really be despair at all. Despair is born out of imbalance of something unnatural. So yes, despair is a possibility—but not in the way a simple illness is a possibility. It is birn from an ongoing confusion of the self of which we are responsible. To make this clearer, Kierkegaard gives a long example (and honestly, I think he knows the reader needs help here). When a sick person catches a disease, we can say: first there was the possibility of the disease, then at some point it became actual. We can even trace the moment (roughly) when it began. It would be strange to say the person “catches the disease at every instant.” But with despair, Kierkegaard says something like this: *every moment of actuality remains tied to possibility*. Despair doesn’t start cleanly at one fixed time, the way a disease does. At any moment, a person either is or isn’t in despair—and Kierkegaard makes it clear that *not* being in despair is much harder than being in it. Despair is born from the self, and since the self is recursive, you can’t simply step outside of it. You can’t escape the self, so you can’t escape the despair unless you are extremely careful.

At that point you might think about suicide as an escape (that escalated quickly !!!). But for Kierkegaard this doesn’t even solve anything, because the self is tied to God and therefore tied to the eternal. So bodily death is not the exit it seems to be. It becomes, instead, another expression of not willing to be oneself—precisely the sickness unto death. You don’t “die” in the usual physical sense; you “die” more deeply, spiritually, as the self breaks in relation to eternity. 
(Not the most fun section 😅 But don’t worry—it *does* get better later.)

**In summary :** The synthesis is the structure that gives us the capacity for despair (possibility), but it is our failure to actively balance and ground that structure in God that makes the sickness real (actuality) at every single instant.

### Despair as a deadly sickness

This section goes much deeper into what “death” means here, and how despair *truly* kills you (to continue on fun and joy).

As we already said, a “sickness unto death” is a sickness that ultimately leads to death. But for Kierkegaard this is not death in a figurative sense nor is it ultimate. It is an absolute kind of death—and it is **not** bodily death (at least not from the believer’s point of view). He writes:

> “There is from the Christian standpoint no earthly, bodily sickness unto death. For death is doubtless the last phase of the sickness unto death [...]. It must be one in which the last thing is death and death is the last thing, and this is precisely despair.”

The twist of despair is that, even though it is described as a “death,” it does not simply *kill*. Kierkegaard says:

> “The torment is precisely this, not to be able to die.”

And that makes sense in his framework: despair is so dreadful that it can overshadow bodily death itself.

> “When death is the grandest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death.”

So yes: the despairing person may seek bodily death because life becomes unbearable—or at least that is the direction despair can drift toward. But Kierkegaard’s tragic point is that “the despairing man cannot die,” precisely because the self is tied to the eternal. In other words, suicide is not a real escape. At best, it would only be despair standing before eternity.

Worse, despair is self-consuming. Because it is a sickness of the self—and the self is recursive, inward, a relation that turns back on itself—despair eats at you moment by moment. And realizing that you are in despair often makes you even more despairing. The despairer consumes himself… and yet, tragically, cannot be consumed completely. He is condemned to remain.

> “By despair, fire has entered into something that cannot burn, or cannot burn up, that is, into the self.”

Kierkegaard also insists that when someone despairs *over something*, they are in fact despairing *over themselves*. Because despair is a sickness of the self. His example is telling:

> “Because he did not become Caesar he now cannot endure to be himself. So properly, he is not in despair over the fact that he did not become Caesar but he is in despair over himself for the fact that he did not become Caesar. [...] If he had become Caesar he would have been rid of himself in desperation but now that he did not become Caesar he cannot in desperation get rid of himself. Essentially he is equally in despair.”

The point is brutal: as long as the person is not “in phase” with himself, becoming someone else—someone supposedly better—doesn’t solve anything. It just becomes another way of refusing the self: either by pretending, or by failing, or by hating what one is.

For Kierkegaard, this impossibility of “burning up”—this inability to die even while being consumed—is itself a sign of the eternal:

> “So also we can demonstrate the eternal in man from the fact that despair cannot consume his self, that this precisely is the torment of contradiction of despair.”

This is also where responsibility comes in. Even if we don’t *know* we are in despair—if we lose ourselves in comfort or happiness in a way that makes despair invisible—Kierkegaard thinks that can still be despair: another form of not willing to be our true self (and, ultimately, of not relating ourselves to God).

He writes:

> “And thus in eternity, one must act, because to have a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.”

A beautiful sentence (one of many): the self is a gift, but also a responsibility before eternity. And it is precisely failing to carry that responsibility—failing to “be” the self rightly—that opens the space for despair.
