*This page gathers my thoughts while I'm reading Søren Kierkegaard’s essay **The Sickness Unto Death**, chapter by chapter.  
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!*

## Preface

My first impression is that Kierkegaard does **not** want his work to be compared to the work of scientists. I’m not sure whether this comes from a broader, traditional opposition (in his time) between theology and science, or whether it is something more singular to Kierkegaard’s own vision.

One line I underlined captures this concern clearly:

> “If [...] the form is too strict to be edifying, that according to my conception would be a fault.”

In other words, if a text is *formally correct* but fails to *edify*—to build up the reader inwardly—then it has missed its purpose. To me, that emphasis feels strikingly unfamiliar today.

Kierkegaard seems to criticize scientific thinking when it presents itself as *the* defining ideal of humanity. He resists the idea that understanding should come primarily from neutral, exterior observation—knowledge “from the outside,” for its own sake. Instead, he opposes this to what he calls **Christian heroism**, rooted in holiness.

For Kierkegaard, the true concern must be tied to:

> “the reality of personal existence.”

This reminds me that Kierkegaard is, before anything else, a Christian believer.[^belief-note] His suspicion toward “neutral” understanding is very strong—almost the reverse of modern intellectual instincts. Today, neutrality often feels like the holy grail of intelligence; for him, holiness is the only seriousness that matters.

He writes:

> “Seriousness is the edifying.”

I take this to mean: the only seriousness he ultimately recognizes is the seriousness of the spiritual life—seriousness before God.

Finally, Kierkegaard anticipates that the essay’s form may seem convoluted. He seems to emphasize this partly to avoid misunderstanding: **despair is not a cure**, and it is not a positive concept. It is, plainly, a **sickness of the spirit**.

This will matter in the chapters that follow, because despair is a deeply polarized idea in Kierkegaard—what he calls a **dialectical** concept.

[^belief-note]: “Christian” could likely be replaced with “religious” in a broader sense (depending on what one wants to emphasize), but Kierkegaard’s framework here is explicitly Christian.
