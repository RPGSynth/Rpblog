*This page gathers my thoughts while I'm reading Søren Kierkegaard’s essay **The Sickness Unto Death**, chapter by chapter.  
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do !*

<!--more-->

It’s important to note that *The Sickness Unto Death* is written by Søren Kierkegaard, but it is **not** signed with his own name. He publishes it under the pseudonym **Anti-Climacus**.

This matters, because Kierkegaard didn’t use pseudonyms randomly: across his work, different names often speak from different “positions” or voices—almost like different angles of the same life. And *The Sickness Unto Death* is a profoundly theological book, written with a tone that can feel severe.

My understanding is that Kierkegaard hesitated to sign such a work as “Kierkegaard,” partly because he did not see himself as a perfect Christian. If he spoke in this voice under his own name, it could sound self-righteous—or at least strangely confident. So he lets **Anti-Climacus** speak instead: a voice that represents a more *idealized* Christian standpoint than Kierkegaard felt he personally embodied.

This also connects to **Johannes Climacus** (we will treat him on this blog eventually ! ), another pseudonym Kierkegaard uses elsewhere. Climacus is a more “ordinary” voice: Socratic, ironic, and philosophically minded. He does not speak *as* a Christian authority (and often doesn’t even claim Christianity at all). Instead, he explores how far reason can go, where it breaks, and what it means to stand at the edge of faith without simply resolving everything into a system. So, in a way, *Anti*-Climacus speaks from the opposite height: not the thinker circling around faith from the outside, but an idealized Christian voice speaking from within it, with full seriousness.

For me, this changes how we should read the book. The speaker here is not simply “Kierkegaard confessing.” It is Kierkegaard writing through a constructed voice—almost a kind of spiritual ideal, even a fantasy of what it would mean to speak *from* faith with full seriousness. That helps explain why so many statements in the following pages are so absolute.

And it’s also a gentle warning: we probably shouldn’t read every line as a final verdict carved in stone. This is a demanding perspective—*deliberately* demanding—and part of the point is precisely to feel that pressure.

For that reason, in the following sections I will refer to the author as **A-Climacus** (Anti-Climacus), rather than Kierkegaard. It simply reflects more accurately *who is speaking* in the text.

{{< chapter title="Preface" >}}

My first impression is that A-Climacus does **not** want his work to be compared to the work of scientists. I’m not sure whether this comes from a broader, traditional opposition (in his time) between theology and science, or whether it is something more singular to A-Climacus' own vision.

One line I underlined captures this concern clearly:

> “If [...] the form is too strict to be edifying, that according to my conception would be a fault.”

In other words, if a text is *formally correct* but fails to *edify*—to build up the reader inwardly—then it has missed its purpose. To me, that emphasis feels strikingly unfamiliar today.

A-Climacus seems to criticize scientific thinking when it presents itself as *the* defining ideal of humanity. He resists the idea that understanding should come primarily from neutral, exterior observation—knowledge “from the outside,” for its own sake. Instead, he opposes this to what he calls **Christian heroism**, rooted in holiness.

For A-Climacus, the true concern must be tied to our inwards feelings:

> “Concern implies relationship to life to the reality of personal existence.”

This reminds me that A-Climacus is, before anything else, a Christian believer.[^belief-note] His suspicion toward “neutral” understanding is very strong—almost the reverse of modern intellectual instincts. Today, neutrality often feels like the holy grail of intelligence; for him, holiness is the only seriousness that matters.

He writes:

> “Seriousness again is the edifying.”

I take this to mean: the only seriousness he ultimately recognizes is the seriousness of the spiritual life—seriousness before God.

Finally, A-Climacus anticipates that the essay’s form may seem convoluted. He seems to emphasize this partly to avoid misunderstanding: **despair is not a cure**, and it is not a positive concept. It is, plainly, a **sickness of the spirit**.

This will matter in the chapters that follow, because despair is a deeply polarized idea in A-Climacus—what he calls a **dialectical** concept.

[^belief-note]: "Christian" could likely be replaced with "religious" in a broader sense (depending on what one wants to emphasize), but A-Climacus' framework here is explicitly Christian.

{{< /chapter >}}

{{< chapter title="Introduction" >}}
In the *Introduction*, A-Climacus mostly present the idea that there exists a true sickness that is worse than death or should I say worse than bodily death. 

He starts with a quote from the Bible:

> “So then Lazarus is dead, and yet this sickness was not unto death; [...]”

That caught my attention because direct Bible quotes are not *that* frequent in the essay (at least so far, this is the only one I’ve met). And it also works as a perfect summary of the core idea: **bodily death is not the “true” death**. So the “sickness unto death” has to be something else—something deeper.

A-Climacus says it quite clearly:

> “Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is only a little event within that which is all, an eternal life; [...]”

From a Christian point of view, death isn’t the final word, in fact it is pretty positive. There is, as he says, “infinitely much more hope” than what we get from a purely human perspective. So if *not even death* is the sickness unto death… then the title becomes even more mesmerizing. If death isn’t it, what on earth is?

And then A-Climacus starts describing this thing. He is genuinely scared of it—and he thinks we should be scared too. He calls it:

> “An evil which as such does not know of”

That’s such a strange and interesting idea: an evil that can exist *without even knowing itself*, like something hidden in plain sight. He also says that non-believers don’t really understand it. He even goes pretty far and compares the non-believer to a child in one of his (numerous) beautiful phrasing :

> “Such is the relation between the natural man and the Christian, it is like the relationship between a child and a man: what the child shudders at the man regards as nothing. The child does not know what the dreadful is; this the man knows, and he shudders at it.”

Not the nicest thing to say about non-believers — but it makes sense if we take seriously how A-Climacus sees things. The “dreadful” here is not bodily death; it’s something spiritual, something deeper. And he argues that the Christian (and he explicitly says “the Christian,” so he is including heathens *as outside of that*) has a kind of courage that non-believers don’t share: the courage to face this dreadful thing.

At this stage he still doesn’t give the full name of the sickness unto death yet, but the shape of it is already there: it’s worse than bodily death, it can hide itself, and it has to do with what a person is in relation to the divine or what he will call later the eternal.

{{< /chapter >}}

{{< chapter title="Chapter 1: That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death" >}}

This chapter is, in many ways, where A-Climacus lays down the foundations of everything that follows. If someone wanted to get a strong sense of his thought without going *too* deep into the essay, I honestly think this chapter could almost be enough. I even hesitated to continue reading—partly because it already feels so complete, and partly because it’s so dense that you want to sit with it for a while.

It’s also just… beautifully written. There are moments of genuine literary ecstasy, the kind where you struggle *not* to highlight every single line. Some pages are almost ridiculous in how good they are. {{< figure src="Screenshots/1.jpg" caption="I am not lying to you when I tell you there is a lot ! " >}}

### Despair and its forms

In my edition of the essay, this sentence "That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death" is printed in **big, bold letters**—and my copy is (sadly? proudly?) being absolutely *murdered* by my highlighter, so the point is not exactly subtle (I warned you this part is rich). This is because this idea is the central claim of the essay: despair—whatever despair really is—brings about a kind of true death, deeper than bodily death. That’s exactly what drew me in: I wanted to understand the feeling of desperation better, and see what intellectuals had to say about it. 

A-Climacus goes straight to the point and I have to cite him:

> “Despair is a sickness of the spirit, in the self. [...] It may assume a triple form: despair at not being conscious of having a self; despair at not willing to be oneself; and despair at willing to be oneself.”

He then proceeds to hit us with a definition that feels almost hypnotic:

> “Man is spirit; but what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self.”

Pretty mesmerizing, honestly.

From there he starts talking in terms of **relations**. Which means… we can represent his ideas with charts! This is great news for me, because I love charts.

He argues that the human being is a **synthesis**—between the infinite and the finite, the spirit and the body. Personally I’m not totally convinced by the spirit-vs-body framing anymore; it feels a bit dated to me. Still, A-Climacus uses this language to build something more subtle, and then he goes into a (honestly convoluted) discussion that I’ve tried to summarize with a couple of graphs. This is also where he introduces his **three** forms of despair (and yes: three is a very satisfying number which feels somewhat subjective).

{{< figure src="Graphs/G1.png" caption="The soul as a relation between the spirit and the body." >}}
{{< figure src="Graphs/G2.png" caption="The self as a relation that relates itself to itself." >}}

He sees the soul as a relation between spirit and body. And he argues that the **self** appears when this relation *turns back on itself*—when the relation relates to itself. I find this idea genuinely elegant: it captures something deeply recursive about inward feelings, the way we can feel, then feel ourselves feeling, then reflect on that reflection… and so on. I never quite manged to put words on this feelings and I feel like he did. 

He then says this “self-relation” can be understood in two ways: one where the relation constitutes itself (see the graph above), and one where it is constituted by another—namely, God (see below).
{{< figure src="Graphs/G3.png" caption="The self as a relation that relates itself to itself and god." >}}
Here, because A-Climacus is a believer—a **Christian** believer—he insists that the synthesis (this recursive relation between spirit and body) is also related to **God**. So if a person is not properly related to God, their synthesis—meaning their self[^self-def-note]—is doomed to fall out of balance. And for A-Climacus, that imbalance is exactly what opens the door to despair.

He argues that if the self *constitutes itself*—if God has no role in it—then despair can only take one form: **not willing to be one’s own self**. In that secular framework, there shouldn’t really be “despair at willing to be oneself,” because if *you* are the one defining what you are at every moment, then willing to be yourself shouldn’t fundamentally be a problem. This is actually interesting, because it starts to sound a bit like some non-believer existentialism.

[^self-def-note]: The “self,” the “synthesis” between spirit and body, and the “relation relating itself to itself” are all, for A-Climacus, different ways of pointing to the same idea. I use them interchangeably (more or less the way he does).

A-Climacus writes:

> “The self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to the Power which constituted the whole relation.”

So without acknowledging God (the divine), the self cannot remain stable: it is destined to become unbalanced. And this is where A-Climacus' warning becomes strong: **trying to become yourself without relating yourself to God is dangerous**. In fact, you may sink deeper into despair, because you are trying to “achieve yourself” through your own effort alone. For A-Climacus, you can’t just work on yourself to find yourself—you must also find yourself *in God*.

In that sense, “despair at willing to be yourself” becomes, for him, another form of despair that ultimately still belongs under the larger umbrella of “not willing to be yourself”: by willing to be yourself so intensely, you end up refusing the only grounding that can truly hold the self together.

He warns:

> “If a man in despair is as he thinks conscious of his despair, [...] and if by himself only he would abolish the despair; then by all labor he expends he is only laboring himself deeper and deeper into despair.”

This is one of the moments where the text shows how deeply theological it is. A-Climacus doesn’t really try to “prove” that the secular (no-God) view is wrong. He assumes it is incomplete, and then he pushes forward from there. He tells us: even the project of pursuing your own self—if it is done without God—is itself despair.

Of course, if you don’t believe in God, you might feel that the first definition is enough—and that trying to be yourself cannot, *by itself*, be despair. A-Climacus refuses that. And honestly, at this point it’s hard to sort everything into simple “right” or “wrong.” I also don’t think that’s what the essay is trying to do: it never sets out to prove or disprove the existence of God. God is assumed as a given, and the whole argument unfolds from that starting point.

### Possibility and Actuality of Despair

This is the part I struggled with at first—probably because I hadn’t really been exposed (before A-Climacus) to the whole philosophy dialogue around *actuality vs possibility* (and, later, *necessity vs possibility*). Here, A-Climacus explains why despair is what he calls **dialectical**: because despair is self-reflective, it can’t be described as a simple possibility *or* a simple actuality. It is both at once, tied together in movement. He will later extend this structure to other opposed pairs as well (finitude/infinitude, temporal/eternal, etc.).

A-Climacus starts with a tempting question: isn’t despair—at least as a *possibility*—a good thing? One might think that the possibility of despair is an advantage over the beast. After all, a tuna (some might heavily disagree, but that deserves an other -series of- post) cannot despair because it has no spirit. The fact that we can despair proves we have a relationship to the eternal, it makes the human closer to God, since after all he writes

> To be healed of this sickness is the Christian bliss.

But he immediately corrects this.
In a normal case, possibility and actuality don’t relate in a dialectical way. I’m paraphrasing, but he basically says: *Normally, if it’s an advantage to be able to be something, it is an even greater advantage to actually be it.* But with despair, it doesn’t work like that. The **possibility** of despair can indeed be an advantage (and even an infinite one, if it leads the despairer toward God). Yet the **actuality** of despair is also infinitely dangerous, because in despair the self can lose itself—perhaps forever.

And because despair is dialectical, because possibility and actuality are always intertwined, always together yet always opposed—we have to fight it constantly. The positive “actuality” of *not* being in despair is not something that simply *rests there*: it is a kind of negation, the possibility of despair continually held in check—an annihilated possibility.

Another important point: the synthesis (the spirit–body relation, also called the soul) is *only* the **possibility** of despair. If despair were the **actuality** built into human nature from the start, then despair would be universal and “normal”—and in that case it wouldn’t really be despair at all. Despair is born out of imbalance of something unnatural. So yes, despair is a possibility—but not in the way a simple illness is a possibility. It is birn from an ongoing confusion of the self of which we are responsible. To make this clearer, A-Climacus gives a long example (and honestly, I think he knows the reader needs help here). When a sick person catches a disease, we can say: first there was the possibility of the disease, then at some point it became actual. We can even trace the moment (roughly) when it began. It would be strange to say the person “catches the disease at every instant.” But with despair, A-Climacus says something like this: *every moment of actuality remains tied to possibility*. Despair doesn’t start cleanly at one fixed time, the way a disease does. At any moment, a person either is or isn’t in despair—and A-Climacus makes it clear that *not* being in despair is much harder than being in it. Despair is born from the self, and since the self is recursive, you can’t simply step outside of it. You can’t escape the self, so you can’t escape the despair unless you are extremely careful.

At that point you might think about suicide as an escape (that escalated quickly !!!). But for A-Climacus this doesn’t even solve anything, because the self is tied to God and therefore tied to the eternal. So bodily death is not the exit it seems to be. It becomes, instead, another expression of not willing to be oneself—precisely the sickness unto death. You don’t “die” in the usual physical sense; you “die” more deeply, spiritually, as the self breaks in relation to eternity. 
(Not the most fun section 😅 But don’t worry—it *does* get better later.)

**In summary :** The synthesis is the structure that gives us the capacity for despair (possibility), but it is our failure to actively balance and ground that structure in God that makes the sickness real (actuality) at every single instant.

### Despair as a deadly sickness

This section goes much deeper into what “death” means here, and how despair *truly* kills you (to continue on fun and joy).

As we already said, a “sickness unto death” is a sickness that ultimately leads to death. But for A-Climacus this is not death in a figurative sense nor is it ultimate. It is an absolute kind of death—and it is **not** bodily death (at least not from the believer’s point of view). He writes:

> “There is from the Christian standpoint no earthly, bodily sickness unto death. For death is doubtless the last phase of the sickness unto death [...]. It must be one in which the last thing is death and death is the last thing, and this is precisely despair.”

The twist of despair is that, even though it is described as a “death,” it does not simply *kill*. A-Climacus says:

> “The torment is precisely this, not to be able to die.”

And that makes sense in his framework: despair is so dreadful that it can overshadow bodily death itself.

> “When death is the grandest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death.”

So yes: the despairing person may seek bodily death because life becomes unbearable—or at least that is the direction despair can drift toward. But A-Climacus' tragic point is that “the despairing man cannot die,” precisely because the self is tied to the eternal. In other words, suicide is not a real escape. At best, it would only be despair standing before eternity.

Worse, despair is self-consuming. Because it is a sickness of the self—and the self is recursive, inward, a relation that turns back on itself—despair eats at you moment by moment. And realizing that you are in despair often makes you even more despairing. The despairer consumes himself… and yet, tragically, cannot be consumed completely. He is condemned to remain.

> “By despair, fire has entered into something that cannot burn, or cannot burn up, that is, into the self.”

A-Climacus also insists that when someone despairs *over something*, they are in fact despairing *over themselves*. Because despair is a sickness of the self. His example is telling:

> “Because he did not become Caesar he now cannot endure to be himself. So properly, he is not in despair over the fact that he did not become Caesar but he is in despair over himself for the fact that he did not become Caesar. [...] If he had become Caesar he would have been rid of himself in desperation but now that he did not become Caesar he cannot in desperation get rid of himself. Essentially he is equally in despair.”

The point is brutal: as long as the person is not “in phase” with himself, becoming someone else—someone supposedly better—doesn’t solve anything. It just becomes another way of refusing the self: either by pretending, or by failing, or by hating what one is.

For A-Climacus, this impossibility of “burning up”—this inability to die even while being consumed—is itself a sign of the eternal:

> “So also we can demonstrate the eternal in man from the fact that despair cannot consume his self, that this precisely is the torment of contradiction of despair.”

This is also where responsibility comes in. Even if we don’t *know* we are in despair—if we lose ourselves in comfort or happiness in a way that makes despair invisible—A-Climacus thinks that can still be despair: another form of not willing to be our true self (and, ultimately, of not relating ourselves to God).

He writes:

> “And thus in eternity, one must act, because to have a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.”

A beautiful sentence (one of many): the self is a gift, but also a responsibility before eternity. And it is precisely failing to carry that responsibility—failing to “be” the self rightly—that opens the space for despair.

{{< /chapter >}}

{{< chapter title="The Universality of Despair" >}}
This chapter opens with an idea I really like:

> “There lives perhaps not one single man who is in perfect health, so one might say perhaps that there lives not one single man who after all is not to some extent in despair.”

Here A-Climacus recognizes that despair is what I would call a *smooth* concept: more like a continuous field of infinite nuance than a neat little category you either belong to or not. And since I’m generally a big partisan of “the world is smooth, not classified,” I enjoy this a lot.

He then pushes it further:

> “There lives no one outside of Christendom who is not in despair.”

So essentially, all non-Christians (whom he later calls “pagans”) are in despair—even if they don’t know it. You might think that’s a pretty depressing conclusion: we’re all doomed to despair from the moment we’re born, and none of us can really escape it. But A-Climacus doesn’t reduce despair to *suffering*, and he adds something unexpected: this universality is actually **good news**. Why? Because it views every person as somethig bigger, related to God :

> “[...] since it views every man in the aspect of the highest demand made upon him, that he be spirit.”

Now, A-Climacus also says that in the real world despair is deeply misunderstood. People often treat it like a rare mental illness—something that happens to the unfortunate. He writes:

> “Whoever says that he is in despair is regarded as being in despair, but whoever thinks he is not in despair is not so regarded. Consequently despair becomes a rather rare phenomenon, whereas in fact it is quite universal.”

That rings true to me. Many people can be deeply “out of balance” without putting the word *despair* on it (whether or not you tie that to God is up to you). So the “non-despairing” person is, for A-Climacus, actually the exception—and trusting someone simply because they say “I’m not in despair” is, at best, naive. After all, one form of despair is precisely **not being aware of it** (and we’ll dive deeper into that later).

He gives a metaphor with bodily illness: a sick person might go to the doctor and insist they’re fine, while the examination reveals the opposite. And the “imaginary sick man” (le *malade imaginaire*) is another case: only the physician can tell who is sick and who is not. So who is the physician of the soul? A-Climacus doesn’t spell it out here, but I think he makes it… pretty obvious that it is related to the clergy. The main point is: personal experience alone isn’t always reliable, especially when the person claims they are *not* in despair (which is probably the most common case).

Importantly, not even youth or joy escapes the universality of despair. A-Climacus suggests that despair’s favorite hiding place is *immediate happiness*—because immediacy can function like a shield against reflection, doubt, and “nothingness.” He writes (in a long, very A-Climacus passage 😅):

> “...for the dearest and most attractive dwelling-place of despair is in the very heart of immediate happiness...”

He even gives the example of “feminine youthfulness,” which we can obviously criticize as old-fashioned language, but the point is clear: even the sweetest, most harmonious kind of youthful joy can still be despair, if it rests on immediacy and refuses the deeper reflection of spirit.

Then another dialectical twist appears: it is a misfortune to have despair, but it is also a misfortune *not* to have it—because then you can’t be healed of it. This will be explored more later, but the intuition is already here: the person who realizes their despair may be closer to leaving it than the person who doesn’t.

Often (and I have to say I agree), it is life’s hardship that awakens spirituality—because it forces reflection, and reflection breaks the illusion of immediacy.

Here something small but interesting happens: A-Climacus writes **“I seek”** (page 21 in my edition). It’s the first time in the book (so far) that he writes *I*, and it’s worth mentioning. He expresses genuine sadness about human misery. For him, it is tragic that people—even brilliant people—do not see themselves as spirit. He despises how

> “...for the masses of men, the people employ them about everything else, utilize them to generate the power for the theater of life, but never remind them of their blessedness.”

What a strong statement. He goes even further:

> “I could weep for eternity over the fact that such misery exists!”

And the misery he means is this:

> “That despair can be so hidden in a man that he himself does not know it.”

People get used as production tools, stripped of their connection to spirit. And when we die, social status no longer matters, nor anything else—only what we are in relation to the eternal.

He ends the chapter with an ominous judgement (something he hasn’t quite done yet, at least not this directly):

> “Eternity asks of thee and of every individual among these million millions only one question: thou hast lived in despair or not. [...] It knows thee as thou art known, it puts thee under arrest by thyself in despair.”

So: if you lived in despair—whether conscious or unconscious—then despair becomes your arrest. While you are alive, you can still move, change, become yourself. But once you die, there is only what you are. And if you are “disbalanced,” you remain disbalanced.

Of course this all makes sense inside A-Climacus' framework: despair is tied to eternity, to the cleanliness of the soul. We can already anticipate that despair will start to look like **sin**—something that judges us before eternity.
